# Incandescent - Godot

Taking inspiration from Dani's [Fair 'n Square](https://danidev.itch.io/fair-n-square) and Askiisoft's [Katana:ZERO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/460950/Katana_ZERO/), **Incandescent** is a 2d side-view focused on frame-perfect inputs in which you try to survive the bad guys and take back your cat.

## Disclaimer

Yes, this is an attempt at a port of [the Unity version](https://github.com/CalcoDev/Incandescent) of this project. I ran into a few issues while working with pixel-perfect in Unity, and decided that the only obvious choice was to learn a new game engine and port the game.

Currently using Godot 4 beta 10, I need lights, and this is the latest version at the time of development.
## Description

For the 2<sup>nd</sup> game at Company<sup>TM</sup>, this project should showcase the company's programming, designing and polishing expertise. Thus I have decided to choose a genre allowing me to focus on exactly that, and throw art, my weak-point, under the rug.

This should also serve as one of the first fully finished prototypes / games, as all the previous demos have been ... unpolished to say the least.
